    "intro-title": "What is TRAILS",
    "intro-content": "TRAILS was originally developed for first responders, with a focus on robustness and ease of deployment. The wearable device, equipped with sensors, as well as an AI engine, detects the userâ€™s location and sends it to the cloud via an API. The collected information is then displayed on a dashboard, making it easily accessible. This innovative architecture ensures that the system is virtually immune to interference issues, while significantly simplifying the setup process. (Patent pending.)",
    "feature-1": "No Beacon Required",
    "feature-1-content": "TRAILS doesn't require beacons for positioning. It uses wearable devices with an AI engine for accurate location tracking.",
    "feature-2": "Seamless",
    "feature-2-content": "TRAILS eliminates the need to extend the beacon mesh beyond the building by providing a seamless indoor/outdoor location ability."
